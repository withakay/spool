# Spool Archive Change Skill Spec

## Purpose

Define the `/spool-archive-change` skill behavior for archiving completed changes.

## Requirements

### Requirement: Spool Archive Change Skill

The system SHALL provide an `/spool-archive-change` skill that archives completed changes in the experimental workflow.

#### Scenario: Archive a change with all artifacts complete

- **WHEN** agent executes `/spool-archive-change` with a change name
- **AND** all artifacts in the schema are complete
- **AND** all tasks are complete
- **THEN** the agent moves the change to `spool/changes/archive/YYYY-MM-DD-<name>/`
- **AND** displays success message with archived location

#### Scenario: Change selection prompt

- **WHEN** agent executes `/spool-archive-change` without specifying a change
- **THEN** the agent prompts user to select from available changes
- **AND** shows only active changes (excludes archive/)

### Requirement: Artifact Completion Check

The skill SHALL check artifact completion status using the artifact graph before archiving.

#### Scenario: Incomplete artifacts warning

- **WHEN** agent checks artifact status
- **AND** one or more artifacts have status other than `done`
- **THEN** display warning listing incomplete artifacts
- **AND** prompt user for confirmation to continue
- **AND** proceed if user confirms

#### Scenario: All artifacts complete

- **WHEN** agent checks artifact status
- **AND** all artifacts have status `done`
- **THEN** proceed without warning

### Requirement: Task Completion Check

The skill SHALL check task completion status from tasks.md before archiving.

#### Scenario: Incomplete tasks found

- **WHEN** agent reads tasks.md
- **AND** incomplete tasks are found (marked with `- [ ]`)
- **THEN** display warning showing count of incomplete tasks
- **AND** prompt user for confirmation to continue
- **AND** proceed if user confirms

#### Scenario: All tasks complete

- **WHEN** agent reads tasks.md
- **AND** all tasks are complete (marked with `- [x]`)
- **THEN** proceed without task-related warning

#### Scenario: No tasks file

- **WHEN** tasks.md does not exist
- **THEN** proceed without task-related warning

### Requirement: Spec Sync Prompt

The skill SHALL prompt to sync delta specs before archiving if specs exist.

#### Scenario: Delta specs exist

- **WHEN** agent checks for delta specs
- **AND** `specs/` directory exists in the change with spec files
- **THEN** prompt user: "This change has delta specs. Would you like to sync them to main specs before archiving?"
- **AND** if user confirms, execute `/spool-sync-specs` logic
- **AND** proceed with archive regardless of sync choice

#### Scenario: No delta specs

- **WHEN** agent checks for delta specs
- **AND** no `specs/` directory or no spec files exist
- **THEN** proceed without sync prompt

### Requirement: Archive Process

The skill SHALL move the change to the archive folder with date prefix.

#### Scenario: Successful archive

- **WHEN** archiving a change
- **THEN** create `archive/` directory if it doesn't exist
- **AND** generate target name as `YYYY-MM-DD-<change-name>` using current date
- **AND** move entire change directory to archive location
- **AND** preserve `.spool.yaml` file in archived change

#### Scenario: Archive already exists

- **WHEN** target archive directory already exists
- **THEN** fail with error message
- **AND** suggest renaming existing archive or using different date

### Requirement: Skill Output

The skill SHALL provide clear feedback about the archive operation.

#### Scenario: Archive complete with sync

- **WHEN** archive completes after syncing specs
- **THEN** display summary:
  - Specs synced (from `/spool-sync-specs` output)
  - Change archived to location
  - Schema that was used

#### Scenario: Archive complete without sync

- **WHEN** archive completes without syncing specs
- **THEN** display summary:
  - Note that specs were not synced (if applicable)
  - Change archived to location
  - Schema that was used

#### Scenario: Archive complete with warnings

- **WHEN** archive completes with incomplete artifacts or tasks
- **THEN** include note about what was incomplete
- **AND** suggest reviewing if archive was intentional
