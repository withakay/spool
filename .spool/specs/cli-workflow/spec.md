- **AND** include workflow context (name, description, variables)
- **AND** list waves and tasks in execution order
- **AND** provide guidance on how to work through tasks in each wave
- **AND** include checkpoint notifications where specified

#### Scenario: Resume workflow execution

- **WHEN** executing `spool workflow run <workflow-name>` and a state file exists
- **THEN** read `.spool/workflows/.state/<workflow-name>.json`
- **AND** determine the last completed task or wave
- **AND** generate instructions starting from the next incomplete task

- **AND** offer option to restart from beginning instead

### Requirement: Workflow status tracking

The CLI SHALL track execution state for workflows, enabling resumption and progress monitoring.

#### Scenario: Show workflow status

- **WHEN** executing `spool workflow status <workflow-name>`
- **THEN** read `.spool/workflows/.state/<workflow-name>.json` if it exists
- **AND** display the workflow's execution status (not started, in-progress, completed)
- **AND** show the current wave and task being executed
- **AND** display progress percentage based on completed tasks
- **AND** show timestamps for start time, last update, and completion (if completed)
- **AND** list completed, pending, and remaining tasks
- **AND** display a message indicating no execution state if state file does not exist

#### Scenario: Update workflow state

- **WHEN** a workflow execution progresses through tasks
- **THEN** update `.spool/workflows/.state/<workflow-name>.json` with:
  - Current wave and task
  - Status of each task (pending, in-progress, complete)
  - Last update timestamp
  - Any variables or outputs generated during execution
- **AND** persist the state file atomically to avoid corruption

### Requirement: Workflow definition format

The CLI SHALL support a YAML workflow definition format with waves, tasks, dependencies, and checkpoints.

#### Scenario: Parse workflow YAML

- **WHEN** reading a workflow YAML file
- **THEN** parse the following structure:
  - `name`: Workflow identifier
  - `description`: Human-readable description
  - `variables`: Optional dictionary of variables with default values
  - `waves`: Array of wave definitions
    - `name`: Wave identifier or description
    - `tasks`: Array of task definitions
      - `id`: Unique task identifier
      - `description`: Task description
      - `dependencies`: Array of task IDs this task depends on (empty if none)
      - `checkpoint`: Boolean flag indicating if task requires human approval
      - `verify`: Optional verification command

## Why

YAML-based workflow orchestration enables teams to define complex, repeatable workflows that work across AI coding assistants. These commands provide:

1. **Workflow definitions**: Declarative YAML format for defining multi-step workflows
2. **Tool integration**: Generate tool-specific instructions from a single workflow definition
3. **State tracking**: Persist execution state across sessions for resumption
4. **Wave-based execution**: Group tasks into waves with dependencies and checkpoints
5. **Team consistency**: Share workflow definitions through version control

Without these tools, teams must manually coordinate complex workflows across sessions and tools, leading to inconsistent execution, lost state, and difficulty collaborating.
