# Git Worktrees

## Purpose
Add an optional Git worktree-based workspace layout so Spool can isolate changes into separate working directories while keeping a small, deterministic "control" checkout for agent entry.

## Scope
- cli-init
- cli-artifact-workflow
- cli-config
- global-config

## Changes
- [x] 012-01_add-git-worktree-support
