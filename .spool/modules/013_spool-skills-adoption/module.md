# Spool Skills Adoption

## Purpose

Adopt and adapt the vendored `spool-skills/` (fork of Superpowers skills) into Spool, enabling consistent workflow instructions across OpenCode, Claude Code, and Codex. All workflow content flows through `spool agent instruction <artifact>` as the single source of truth.

## Depends On

## Scope

- agent-instructions
