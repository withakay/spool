# Implementation Tasks

## 1. CLI Behavior and Help

- \[x\] 1.1 Un-deprecate top-level `spool list`; mark `change list` as deprecated with warning that points to `spool list`
- \[x\] 1.2 Add support to list specs via `spool list --specs` and keep `--changes` as default
- \[x\] 1.3 Update command descriptions and `--help` output to emphasize verb–noun pattern
- \[x\] 1.4 Keep `spool spec ...` and `spool change ...` commands working but print deprecation notices

## 2. Core List Logic

- \[x\] 2.1 Extend `src/core/list.ts` to accept a mode: `changes` (default) or `specs`
- \[x\] 2.2 Implement `specs` listing: scan `spool/specs/*/spec.md`, compute requirement count via parser, format output consistently
- \[x\] 2.3 Share output structure for both modes; preserve current text table; ensure JSON parity in future change

## 3. Specs and Conventions

- \[x\] 3.1 Update `spool/specs/cli-list/spec.md` to document `--specs` (and default to changes)
- \[x\] 3.2 Update `spool/specs/spool-conventions/spec.md` with a requirement for verb–noun CLI design and deprecation guidance

## 4. Tests and Docs

- \[x\] 4.1 Update tests: ensure `spool list` works for changes and specs; keep `change list` tests but assert warning
- \[ \] 4.2 Update README and any usage docs to show new primary commands
- \[ \] 4.3 Add migration notes in repo CHANGELOG or README

## 5. Follow-ups (Optional, not in this change)

- \[ \] 5.1 Consider `spool show --specs/--changes` for discovery without ids
- \[ \] 5.2 Consider JSON output for `spool list` with `--json` for both modes
