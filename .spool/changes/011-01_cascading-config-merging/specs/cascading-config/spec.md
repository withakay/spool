## ADDED Requirements

### Requirement: Cascading project config sources

The system SHALL load project configuration by cascading multiple config files, merging them in precedence order.

Precedence order (lowest to highest):

1. `<repo-root>/spool.json`
2. `<repo-root>/.spool.json`
3. `<spoolDir>/config.json`
4. If `PROJECT_DIR` is set: `$PROJECT_DIR/config.json`

#### Scenario: Later config overrides earlier
- **WHEN** a key is present in multiple config sources
- **THEN** the value from the highest-precedence source is used

### Requirement: Merge semantics

The system SHALL deep-merge JSON objects when combining sources.

#### Scenario: Objects merge recursively
- **WHEN** two sources contain objects at the same key
- **THEN** their child keys are merged recursively

#### Scenario: Arrays are replaced
- **WHEN** two sources contain arrays at the same key
- **THEN** the higher-precedence array replaces the lower-precedence array

### Requirement: Invalid JSON does not break commands

The system MUST treat invalid JSON in optional config sources as non-fatal.

#### Scenario: Invalid project config is ignored
- **WHEN** a config file exists but contains invalid JSON
- **THEN** the system ignores that file for config merging
- **AND** continues using other sources and defaults
