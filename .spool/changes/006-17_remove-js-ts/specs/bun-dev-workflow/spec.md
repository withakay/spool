## REMOVED Requirements
### Requirement: Package.json script execution
This requirement is removed; the system SHALL NOT require Bun for script execution.
**Reason**: Rust-only project; Bun is no longer supported.
**Migration**: Use `make` and `cargo` workflows.

#### Scenario: Bun script runner is not required
- **WHEN** a developer looks for `bun run <script-name>`
- **THEN** the repository SHALL NOT require Bun to build/test/lint Spool

### Requirement: Build workflow
This requirement is removed; the system SHALL build Spool using Rust tooling.
**Reason**: TypeScript build output (`dist/`) is removed.
**Migration**: Use `cargo build` via `make build`.

#### Scenario: Rust build replaces Bun build
- **WHEN** a developer runs `make build`
- **THEN** the build SHALL compile the Rust CLI from `spool-rs/`

### Requirement: Test workflow
This requirement is removed; the system SHALL run tests using Rust tooling.
**Reason**: Vitest-based tests are removed.
**Migration**: Use `cargo test --workspace` via `make test`.

#### Scenario: Rust tests replace vitest
- **WHEN** a developer runs `make test`
- **THEN** tests SHALL run using Rust tooling without Node/Bun

### Requirement: Linting workflow
This requirement is removed; the system SHALL run linting using Rust tooling.
**Reason**: Biome/ESLint-based linting is removed.
**Migration**: Use `cargo fmt` and `cargo clippy` via `make lint`.

#### Scenario: Rust lint replaces JS lint
- **WHEN** a developer runs `make lint`
- **THEN** linting SHALL run using Rust tooling without Node/Bun

### Requirement: Makefile integration
This requirement is removed; the Makefile MUST NOT invoke Bun.
**Reason**: Make targets no longer invoke Bun.
**Migration**: Make targets invoke Rust commands.

#### Scenario: Makefile uses Rust commands
- **WHEN** a developer runs `make build`, `make test`, or `make lint`
- **THEN** the Makefile SHALL run Rust commands (cargo) only

### Requirement: Executable execution via bunx
This requirement is removed; the system SHALL NOT require `bunx`.
**Reason**: No Node executables are required.
**Migration**: Use Rust-installed tooling where needed.

#### Scenario: No bunx usage
- **WHEN** a developer follows the documented workflows
- **THEN** they SHALL NOT need `bunx` for Spool

### Requirement: Development CLI workflow
This requirement is removed; the system SHALL NOT depend on `dist/` JavaScript artifacts.
**Reason**: The TypeScript CLI entrypoint is removed.
**Migration**: Build and run the Rust CLI.

#### Scenario: No dist-based CLI build
- **WHEN** a developer builds Spool
- **THEN** it SHALL NOT rely on `dist/cli/index.js`

### Requirement: Global development installation
This requirement is removed; the system SHALL provide a Rust-native installation path.
**Reason**: Bun global install is removed.
**Migration**: Use `make rust-install`.

#### Scenario: Rust install replaces bun global install
- **WHEN** a developer wants to install Spool locally
- **THEN** `make rust-install` SHALL install the `spool` binary
