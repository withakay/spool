# Architecture Research

## Objective

Research architecture patterns and design considerations for: **{{topic}}**

## Process

1. Identify architectural requirements (scale, latency, consistency)
1. Research relevant architecture patterns
1. Evaluate trade-offs for this specific use case
1. Document key design decisions

## Output Format

### Requirements

- Scale: Expected load and growth
- Latency: Response time requirements
- Consistency: Data consistency needs
- Other constraints

### Architecture Patterns Considered

For each relevant pattern:

- **Pattern Name**
  - Description
  - When to use
  - Trade-offs
  - Relevance to this project

### Recommended Architecture

Describe the recommended approach with diagram (ASCII or description).

### Key Design Decisions

| Decision | Options | Choice | Rationale |
|----------|---------|--------|-----------|
| ... | ... | ... | ... |

### Integration Points

List external systems and how to integrate.
