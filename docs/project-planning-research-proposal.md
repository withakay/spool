# Spool Project Planning & Research Extension

> Tool-agnostic workflow for OpenCode, Codex CLI, Claude Code, and other AI coding assistants

## Executive Summary

This proposal extends Spool with structured project planning, research capabilities, and execution patterns that work across AI coding tools. The design prioritizes **file-based workflows** and **markdown custom commands** that any AI assistant can follow.

**Primary Target**: [OpenCode](https://opencode.ai/) - open source AI coding agent
**Also Supports**: [Codex CLI](https://github.com/openai/codex), [Claude Code](https://docs.anthropic.com/claude-code), and other terminal-based AI assistants

## Design Principles

### Tool-Agnostic Architecture

1. **File-Based State**: All context lives in markdown files, not tool-specific memory
1. **Custom Commands**: Workflows defined as markdown files any tool can load
1. **No Vendor Lock-in**: Works with any AI model (Claude, GPT, Gemini, etc.)
1. **Progressive Enhancement**: Tools with advanced features (subagents) can use them; others work sequentially

### Why File-Based?

| Approach | Pros | Cons |
|----------|------|------|
| Tool-specific APIs | Maximum capability | Vendor lock-in, fragile |
| **File-based (chosen)** | Universal, persistent, debuggable | Slightly more verbose |
| Memory/context only | Simple | Lost between sessions |

______________________________________________________________________

## Problem Statement

Current Spool workflow gaps:

1. **No Research Phase**: Proposals jump directly to specs without domain investigation
1. **No Project-Level Roadmapping**: Changes are isolated; no multi-phase planning
1. **No State Persistence**: Session context lost between restarts
1. **Limited Task Structure**: Checklists lack verification criteria
1. **No Systematic Review**: Plans aren't stress-tested

______________________________________________________________________

## Proposed Extensions

### 1. Research Phase (Pre-Proposal)

Add a research stage that runs **before** proposal creation for complex changes.

```

______________________________________________________________________

### 3. Enhanced Task Structure

Replace simple checklists with structured, verifiable tasks.

#### Current Format (tasks.md)

```markdown
## 1. Implementation
- [ ] 1.1 Create database schema
- [ ] 1.2 Implement API endpoint
```

#### Proposed Format (tasks.md)

```markdown
# Tasks for: [change-id]

## Execution Notes
- **Tool**: Any (OpenCode, Codex, Claude Code)
- **Mode**: Sequential (or parallel if tool supports)

---

## Wave 1

### Task 1.1: Create User Schema
- **Files**: `src/db/schema/user.ts`, `src/db/migrations/001_users.sql`
- **Dependencies**: None
- **Action**:
  Create TypeScript schema definition and SQL migration for users table.
  Include fields: id (uuid), email (unique), created_at, updated_at.
- **Verify**: `bun run db:migrate && bun run test:schema`
- **Done When**: Migration runs successfully, schema types export correctly
- **Status**: [ ] pending / [ ] in-progress / [x] complete

### Task 1.2: Create Auth Schema
- **Files**: `src/db/schema/auth.ts`, `src/db/migrations/002_auth.sql`
- **Dependencies**: None
- **Action**:
  Create sessions and tokens tables for authentication.
- **Verify**: `bun run db:migrate`
- **Done When**: Tables created with foreign key to users
- **Status**: [ ] pending

---

## Wave 2 (after Wave 1 complete)

### Task 2.1: Implement Auth Service
- **Files**: `src/services/auth.ts`, `src/services/auth.test.ts`
- **Dependencies**: Task 1.1, Task 1.2

```

#### Task Types

| Type | Behavior |
|------|----------|
| (default) | Execute autonomously, verify automatically |
| `checkpoint` | Pause for human review before proceeding |
| `decision` | Present options, wait for user choice |
| `research` | Investigate and report, don't implement |

______________________________________________________________________

### 4. Execution Model

#### For Tools WITH Subagent Support (Claude Code)

```
Orchestrator (lean context)
├── Spawns: Executor for Task 1.1 (fresh context)
├── Spawns: Executor for Task 1.2 (fresh context)
    │
    ▼ (all complete)
├── Spawns: Executor for Task 2.1 (fresh context)
```

#### For Tools WITHOUT Subagent Support (OpenCode, Codex)

Sequential execution with context preservation via files:

```
1. Load STATE.md and tasks.md
2. Find first pending task
3. Execute task
4. Run verify command
5. Update task status in tasks.md
6. Commit changes
7. Update STATE.md with session notes
8. Repeat from step 2
```

#### Execution Command (Custom Command)

**`spool/commands/execute.md`**

```markdown
# Execute Spool Tasks

## Objective
Execute tasks from a change proposal sequentially, verifying each before proceeding.

## Process
1. Read `spool/planning/STATE.md` for current context
2. Read the specified change's `tasks.md`
3. Find the first task with status `[ ] pending`
4. Execute the task:
   a. Read the files listed
   b. Perform the action described
   c. Run the verify command
   d. If verify passes, mark status as `[x] complete`
   e. If verify fails, stop and report the issue
5. Commit the changes with message: `feat([change-id]): [task name]`
6. Update STATE.md with session notes
7. Proceed to next pending task

## On Completion
- Update ROADMAP.md if all tasks complete
- Report summary of completed work
```

______________________________________________________________________

### 5. Adversarial Review (Red Team)

Add systematic challenge phase to stress-test proposals.

#### Review Prompts

Store as custom commands that any tool can execute:

**`spool/commands/review-security.md`**

```markdown
# Security Review

## Objective
Find security vulnerabilities in the proposed changes.

## Perspective
You are a security researcher. Assume attackers are sophisticated.
Find ways to exploit, bypass, or abuse the proposed system.

## Process
1. Read the proposal and affected specs
2. Identify attack vectors:
   - Authentication/authorization bypasses
   - Injection points (SQL, XSS, command)
   - Data exposure risks
   - CSRF/SSRF vulnerabilities
3. Rate each finding: HIGH / MEDIUM / LOW
4. Suggest mitigations

## Output
Append findings to `spool/changes/[change-id]/REVIEW.md`
```

**`spool/commands/review-scale.md`**

```markdown
# Scale Review

## Objective
Identify performance bottlenecks and scaling issues.

## Perspective
What breaks at 10x, 100x, 1000x scale?

## Process
1. Review database queries for N+1 problems
2. Check for missing indexes
3. Identify memory-intensive operations
4. Look for blocking calls in hot paths
5. Evaluate caching opportunities

## Output
Append findings to `spool/changes/[change-id]/REVIEW.md`
```

#### REVIEW.md Template

```markdown
# Adversarial Review: [change-id]

## Security Review
### Issues Found
- **HIGH**: [Issue description]
  - Attack vector: [How exploited]
  - Mitigation: [Required fix]
  - Status: [ ] Addressed

### Recommendations

  - Trigger: [How to reproduce]
  - Handling: [Expected behavior]
  - Status: [ ] Addressed

## Summary
- Critical issues: [count]
- Must address before implementation: [list]
- Can defer: [list]
- Approved for implementation: [ ] Yes / [ ] No
```

### 6. Custom Commands

Spool workflows are implemented as markdown custom commands compatible with all tools.

#### Directory Structure

```
spool/
├── commands/                    # Custom command definitions
│   ├── research-stack.md       # Stack analysis
│   ├── research-features.md    # Feature landscape
│   ├── research-pitfalls.md    # Risk identification
│   ├── research-synthesize.md  # Combine findings
│   ├── plan-init.md            # Initialize planning
│   ├── plan-milestone.md       # Create milestone
│   ├── execute.md              # Execute tasks

│   ├── review-edge.md          # Edge case review
│   └── state-update.md         # Update STATE.md
```

#### Tool-Specific Loading

| Tool | How to Load Custom Commands |
|------|---------------------------|
| **OpenCode** | Automatic from `.opencode/commands/` or specify path |
| **Codex CLI** | Load via `@file` or custom instructions |
| **Claude Code** | Custom slash commands or CLAUDE.md |

#### Example: OpenCode Integration

```bash
# Copy commands to OpenCode location
cp -r spool/commands .opencode/commands/spool

# Use in OpenCode
/spool/research-stack "authentication system"
/spool/execute add-user-auth
/spool/review-security add-user-auth
```

______________________________________________________________________

## CLI Commands

The `spool` CLI provides commands that work independently of AI tool:

```bash
# Research commands
spool research init                 # Create research/ structure
spool research status               # Show research progress

# Planning commands
spool plan init                     # Initialize planning/ directory
spool plan milestone [name]         # Create new milestone
spool plan phase [milestone] [name] # Add phase to milestone
spool plan status                   # Show roadmap progress

# State commands
spool state                         # Show current STATE.md
spool state decision "[text]"       # Record a decision
spool state blocker "[text]"        # Record a blocker
spool state note "[text]"           # Add session note

# Validation
spool validate [change-id] --strict # Validate including tasks format
```
