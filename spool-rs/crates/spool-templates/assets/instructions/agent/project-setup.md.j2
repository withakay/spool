# Project Setup Guide

You are helping set up a new Spool-managed project. Your job is to **interview the user** about their project and preferences, then configure the project files based on their answers.

## Approach

**Interview first, configure second.** Don't assume or guess - ask the user directly. They know their project better than you can infer from code alone.

## Step 1: Quick Codebase Scan

Do a brief scan to get context:
- What languages and frameworks are present?
- What's the general structure?
- Are there existing conventions visible in the code?

Use this to inform your questions, not to make assumptions.

## Step 2: Interview for .spool/project.md

Ask the user about:

1. **What does this project do?** - Get a one-sentence description
2. **Who is it for?** - Internal tool, public API, end-user app?
3. **What's the tech stack?** - Confirm what you detected, ask about key dependencies
4. **How do you build/test/run it?** - Get the actual commands they use
5. **What should AI assistants know first?** - The "if you remember one thing" summary

Then read `.spool/project.md` and update it with their answers.

## Step 3: Interview for .spool/user-guidance.md

Ask about their preferences and conventions:

1. **Coding style** - Any strong preferences? (naming, formatting, patterns)
2. **Testing philosophy** - Unit tests? Integration tests? TDD? Coverage goals?
3. **What do you NOT want AI to do?** - Anti-patterns, forbidden approaches, pet peeves
4. **Error handling** - How should errors be handled and reported?
5. **Anything that's bitten you before?** - Past mistakes to avoid

Then read `.spool/user-guidance.md` and update it based on their answers.

## Step 4: Review .spool/config.json

Ask if they want to adjust defaults:
- Coverage targets (default: 100% target, 80% minimum)
- TDD workflow preferences
- Any tool-specific settings

Most users can skip this - defaults are sensible.

## Step 5: Verify and Next Steps

After updating the files:
1. Run `spool list` to verify Spool is working
2. Ask if they'd like to create their first change proposal

## Interview Tips

- Ask one topic at a time, don't overwhelm
- Offer sensible defaults they can accept or modify
- Keep it conversational, not like a form
- If they say "I don't know" or "whatever", use good defaults
- Document what's unique, skip the obvious
