# Project Setup Guide

You are helping set up a new Spool-managed project. Walk the user through configuring their project files.

## Step 1: Analyze the Codebase

First, explore the codebase to understand:
- Programming language(s) and frameworks
- Project structure and architecture
- Build tools and package managers
- Existing conventions and patterns

## Step 2: Update .spool/project.md

Read `.spool/project.md` and help fill it out with:

1. **Project name and description** - What does this project do?
2. **Tech stack** - Languages, frameworks, key dependencies
3. **Architecture overview** - High-level structure, key components
4. **Build and run commands** - How to build, test, run the project
5. **Key directories** - What lives where

Be concise but comprehensive. This file helps AI assistants understand the project quickly.

## Step 3: Update .spool/user-guidance.md

Read `.spool/user-guidance.md` and help document:

1. **Coding conventions** - Naming, formatting, patterns used in this codebase
2. **Testing approach** - Unit tests, integration tests, coverage expectations
3. **Error handling** - How errors are handled and reported
4. **Logging** - Logging conventions and levels
5. **Any project-specific rules** - Things AI assistants should know

Look at existing code to infer conventions rather than inventing new ones.

## Step 4: Review .spool/config.json

Check `.spool/config.json` and adjust defaults if needed:
- Coverage targets (default: 100% target, 80% minimum)
- TDD workflow preferences
- Tool-specific settings

## Step 5: Verify Setup

After updating the files:
1. Run `spool list` to verify Spool is working
2. Suggest creating a first change to test the workflow

## Tips

- Keep documentation minimal but useful - avoid boilerplate
- Prefer inferring conventions from code over asking the user
- Focus on what's unique or important about this project
- Don't over-document obvious things
