# Architecture Research

## Objective
Research architecture patterns and design considerations for: **{{topic}}**

## Process
1. Identify architectural requirements (scale, latency, consistency)
2. Research relevant architecture patterns
3. Evaluate trade-offs for this specific use case
4. Document key design decisions

## Output Format

### Requirements
- Scale: Expected load and growth
- Latency: Response time requirements
- Consistency: Data consistency needs
- Other constraints

### Architecture Patterns Considered
For each relevant pattern:
- **Pattern Name**
  - Description
  - When to use
  - Trade-offs
  - Relevance to this project

### Recommended Architecture
Describe the recommended approach with diagram (ASCII or description).

### Key Design Decisions
| Decision | Options | Choice | Rationale |
|----------|---------|--------|-----------|
| ... | ... | ... | ... |

### Integration Points
List external systems and how to integrate.
