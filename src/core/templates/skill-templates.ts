    instructions: `Enter explore mode. Think deeply. Visualize freely. Follow the conversation wherever it goes.

**This is a stance, not a workflow.** There are no fixed steps, no required sequence, no mandatory outputs. You're a thinking partner helping the user explore.

---

## The Stance

- **Curious, not prescriptive** - Ask questions that emerge naturally, don't follow a script
- **Visual** - Use ASCII diagrams liberally when they'd help clarify thinking
- **Adaptive** - Follow interesting threads, pivot when new information emerges
- **Patient** - Don't rush to conclusions, let the shape of the problem emerge
- **Grounded** - Explore the actual codebase when relevant, don't just theorize

---

## What You Might Do

Depending on what the user brings, you might:

**Explore the problem space**
- Ask clarifying questions that emerge from what they said
- Challenge assumptions
- Reframe the problem
- Find analogies

**Investigate the codebase**
- Map existing architecture relevant to the discussion
- Find integration points
- Identify patterns already in use
- Surface hidden complexity

**Compare options**
- Brainstorm multiple approaches
- Build comparison tables
- Sketch tradeoffs
- Recommend a path (if asked)

**Visualize**

**Surface risks and unknowns**
- Identify what could go wrong
- Find gaps in understanding
- Suggest spikes or investigations

## Projector Awareness

You have full context of the Projector system. Use it naturally, don't force it.

### Check for context

At the start, quickly check what exists:
\`\`\`bash
projector list --json
\`\`\`

This tells you:
- If there are active changes
- Their names, schemas, and status
- What the user might be working on

### When no change exists

Think freely. When insights crystallize, you might offer:

- "This feels solid enough to start a change. Want me to create one?"
  → Can transition to \`/opsx:new\` or \`/opsx:ff\`
- Or keep exploring - no pressure to formalize

### When a change exists

If the user mentions a change or you detect one is relevant:

1. **Read existing artifacts for context**
   - \`projector/changes/<name>/proposal.md\`
   - \`projector/changes/<name>/design.md\`
   - \`projector/changes/<name>/tasks.md\`
   - etc.

2. **Reference them naturally in conversation**
   - "Your design mentions using Redis, but we just realized SQLite fits better..."
   - "The proposal scopes this to premium users, but we're now thinking everyone..."

3. **Offer to capture when decisions are made**

   | Insight Type | Where to Capture |
   |--------------|------------------|
   | New requirement discovered | \`specs/<capability>/spec.md\` |
   | Requirement changed | \`specs/<capability>/spec.md\` |
   | Design decision made | \`design.md\` |
   | Scope changed | \`proposal.md\` |
   | New work identified | \`tasks.md\` |
   | Assumption invalidated | Relevant artifact |

   Example offers:
   - "That's a design decision. Capture it in design.md?"
   - "This is a new requirement. Add it to specs?"
   - "This changes scope. Update the proposal?"

4. **The user decides** - Offer and move on. Don't pressure. Don't auto-capture.

---

## What You Don't Have To Do

- Follow a script
- Ask the same questions every time
- Produce a specific artifact
- Reach a conclusion
- Stay on topic if a tangent is valuable
- Be brief (this is thinking time)

---

## Handling Different Entry Points

**User brings a vague idea:**
\`\`\`

**User is stuck mid-implementation:**
\`\`\`
User: /opsx:explore add-auth-system

**User wants to compare options:**

## Ending Discovery

There's no required ending. Discovery might:

- **Flow into action**: "Ready to start? /opsx:new or /opsx:ff"
- **Result in artifact updates**: "Updated design.md with these decisions"
- **Just provide clarity**: User has what they need, moves on
- **Continue later**: "We can pick this up anytime"

When it feels like things are crystallizing, you might summarize:

\`\`\`
## What We Figured Out

**The problem**: [crystallized understanding]

**The approach**: [if one emerged]

**Open questions**: [if any remain]

**Next steps** (if ready):
- Create a change: /opsx:new <name>
- Fast-forward to tasks: /opsx:ff <name>
- Keep exploring: just keep talking
\`\`\`

But this summary is optional. Sometimes the thinking IS the value.

## Guardrails

- **Don't fake understanding** - If something is unclear, dig deeper
- **Don't rush** - Discovery is thinking time, not task time
- **Don't force structure** - Let patterns emerge naturally
- **Don't auto-capture** - Offer to save insights, don't just do it
- **Do visualize** - A good diagram is worth many paragraphs
- **Do explore the codebase** - Ground discussions in reality
- **Do question assumptions** - Including the user's and your own`

export function getNewChangeSkillTemplate(): SkillTemplate {
  return {
    name: 'projector-new-change',
    description: 'Start a new Projector change using the experimental artifact workflow. Use when the user wants to create a new feature, fix, or modification with a structured step-by-step approach.',
    instructions: `Start a new change using the experimental artifact-driven approach.

**Input**: The user's request should include a change name (kebab-case) OR a description of what they want to build.

**Steps**

1. **If no clear input provided, ask what they want to build**

   Use the **AskUserQuestion tool** (open-ended, no preset options) to ask:
   > "What change do you want to work on? Describe what you want to build or fix."

   From their description, derive a kebab-case name (e.g., "add user authentication" → \`add-user-auth\`).

   **IMPORTANT**: Do NOT proceed without understanding what the user wants to build.

2. **Determine the workflow schema**

   Use the default schema (omit \`--schema\`) unless the user explicitly requests a different workflow.

   **Use a different schema only if the user mentions:**
   - "tdd" or "test-driven" → use \`--schema tdd\`
   - A specific schema name → use \`--schema <name>\`
   - "show workflows" or "what workflows" → run \`projector schemas --json\` and let them choose

   **Otherwise**: Omit \`--schema\` to use the default.

3. **Create the change directory**
   \`\`\`bash
   projector new change "<name>"
   \`\`\`
   Add \`--schema <name>\` only if the user requested a specific workflow.
   This creates a scaffolded change at \`projector/changes/<name>/\` with the selected schema.

4. **Show the artifact status**
   \`\`\`bash
   projector status --change "<name>"
   \`\`\`
   This shows which artifacts need to be created and which are ready (dependencies satisfied).

5. **Get instructions for the first artifact**
   The first artifact depends on the schema (e.g., \`proposal\` for spec-driven, \`spec\` for tdd).
   Check the status output to find the first artifact with status "ready".
   \`\`\`bash
   projector instructions <first-artifact-id> --change "<name>"
   \`\`\`
   This outputs the template and context for creating the first artifact.

6. **STOP and wait for user direction**

**Output**

After completing the steps, summarize:
- Change name and location
- Schema/workflow being used and its artifact sequence
- Current status (0/N artifacts complete)
- The template for the first artifact
- Prompt: "Ready to create the first artifact? Just describe what this change is about and I'll draft it, or ask me to continue."

**Guardrails**
- Do NOT create any artifacts yet - just show the instructions
- Do NOT advance beyond showing the first artifact template
- If the name is invalid (not kebab-case), ask for a valid name
- If a change with that name already exists, suggest continuing that change instead
- Pass --schema if using a non-default workflow`

 * Template for projector-continue-change skill

  return {
    name: 'projector-continue-change',
    description: 'Continue working on an Projector change by creating the next artifact. Use when the user wants to progress their change, create the next artifact, or continue their workflow.',
    instructions: `Continue working on a change by creating the next artifact.

**Input**: Optionally specify a change name. If omitted, MUST prompt for available changes.

**Steps**

1. **If no change name provided, prompt for selection**

   Run \`projector list --json\` to get available changes sorted by most recently modified. Then use the **AskUserQuestion tool** to let the user select which change to work on.

   Present the top 3-4 most recently modified changes as options, showing:
   - Change name
   - Schema (from \`schema\` field if present, otherwise "spec-driven")
   - Status (e.g., "0/5 tasks", "complete", "no tasks")
   - How recently it was modified (from \`lastModified\` field)

   Mark the most recently modified change as "(Recommended)" since it's likely what the user wants to continue.

   **IMPORTANT**: Do NOT guess or auto-select a change. Always let the user choose.

2. **Check current status**
   \`\`\`bash
   projector status --change "<name>" --json
   \`\`\`
   Parse the JSON to understand current state. The response includes:
   - \`schemaName\`: The workflow schema being used (e.g., "spec-driven", "tdd")
   - \`artifacts\`: Array of artifacts with their status ("done", "ready", "blocked")
   - \`isComplete\`: Boolean indicating if all artifacts are complete

3. **Act based on status**:

   ---

   **If all artifacts are complete (\`isComplete: true\`)**:
   - Congratulate the user
   - Show final status including the schema used
   - Suggest: "All artifacts created! You can now implement this change or archive it."
   - STOP

   ---

   **If artifacts are ready to create** (status shows artifacts with \`status: "ready"\`):
   - Pick the FIRST artifact with \`status: "ready"\` from the status output
   - Get its instructions:
     \`\`\`bash
     projector instructions <artifact-id> --change "<name>" --json
     \`\`\`
   - Parse the JSON to get template, dependencies, and what it unlocks
   - **Create the artifact file** using the template as a starting point:
     - Read any completed dependency files for context
     - Fill in the template based on context and user's goals
     - Write to the output path specified in instructions
   - Show what was created and what's now unlocked
   - STOP after creating ONE artifact

   ---

   **If no artifacts are ready (all blocked)**:
   - This shouldn't happen with a valid schema
   - Show status and suggest checking for issues

4. **After creating an artifact, show progress**
   \`\`\`bash
   projector status --change "<name>"
   \`\`\`

**Output**

After each invocation, show:
- Which artifact was created
- Schema workflow being used
- Current progress (N/M complete)
- What artifacts are now unlocked
- Prompt: "Want to continue? Just ask me to continue or tell me what to do next."

**Artifact Creation Guidelines**

The artifact types and their purpose depend on the schema. Use the \`instruction\` field from the instructions output to understand what to create.

Common artifact patterns:

**spec-driven schema** (proposal → specs → design → tasks):
- **proposal.md**: Ask user about the change if not clear. Fill in Why, What Changes, Capabilities, Impact.
  - The Capabilities section is critical - each capability listed will need a spec file.
- **specs/*.md**: Create one spec per capability listed in the proposal.
- **design.md**: Document technical decisions, architecture, and implementation approach.
- **tasks.md**: Break down implementation into checkboxed tasks.

**tdd schema** (spec → tests → implementation → docs):
- **spec.md**: Feature specification defining what to build.
- **tests/*.test.ts**: Write tests BEFORE implementation (TDD red phase).
- **src/*.ts**: Implement to make tests pass (TDD green phase).
- **docs/*.md**: Document the implemented feature.

For other schemas, follow the \`instruction\` field from the CLI output.

**Guardrails**
- Create ONE artifact per invocation
- Always read dependency artifacts before creating a new one
- Never skip artifacts or create out of order
- If context is unclear, ask the user before creating
- Verify the artifact file exists after writing before marking progress
- Use the schema's artifact sequence, don't assume specific artifact names`

/**
 * Template for projector-apply-change skill

 */
export function getApplyChangeSkillTemplate(): SkillTemplate {
  return {
    name: 'projector-apply-change',
    description: 'Implement tasks from an Projector change. Use when the user wants to start implementing, continue implementation, or work through tasks.',
    instructions: `Implement tasks from an Projector change.

**Input**: Optionally specify a change name. If omitted, MUST prompt for available changes.

**Steps**

1. **If no change name provided, prompt for selection**

   Run \`projector list --json\` to get available changes. Use the **AskUserQuestion tool** to let the user select.

   Show changes that are implementation-ready (have tasks artifact).
   Include the schema used for each change if available.
   Mark changes with incomplete tasks as "(In Progress)".

   **IMPORTANT**: Do NOT guess or auto-select a change. Always let the user choose.

2. **Check status to understand the schema**
   \`\`\`bash
   projector status --change "<name>" --json
   \`\`\`
   Parse the JSON to understand:
   - \`schemaName\`: The workflow being used (e.g., "spec-driven", "tdd")
   - Which artifact contains the tasks (typically "tasks" for spec-driven, check status for others)

3. **Get apply instructions**

   \`\`\`bash
   projector instructions apply --change "<name>" --json
   \`\`\`

   This returns:
   - Context file paths (varies by schema - could be proposal/specs/design/tasks or spec/tests/implementation/docs)
   - Progress (total, complete, remaining)
   - Task list with status
   - Dynamic instruction based on current state

   **Handle states:**
   - If \`state: "blocked"\` (missing artifacts): show message, suggest using projector-continue-change
   - If \`state: "all_done"\`: congratulate, suggest archive
   - Otherwise: proceed to implementation

4. **Read context files**

   Read the files listed in \`contextFiles\` from the apply instructions output.
   The files depend on the schema being used:
   - **spec-driven**: proposal, specs, design, tasks
   - **tdd**: spec, tests, implementation, docs
   - Other schemas: follow the contextFiles from CLI output

5. **Show current progress**

   Display:
   - Schema being used
   - Progress: "N/M tasks complete"
   - Remaining tasks overview
   - Dynamic instruction from CLI

6. **Implement tasks (loop until done or blocked)**

   For each pending task:
   - Show which task is being worked on
   - Make the code changes required
   - Keep changes minimal and focused
   - Mark task complete in the tasks file: \`- [ ]\` → \`- [x]\`
   - Continue to next task

   **Pause if:**
   - Task is unclear → ask for clarification
   - Implementation reveals a design issue → suggest updating artifacts
   - Error or blocker encountered → report and wait for guidance
   - User interrupts

7. **On completion or pause, show status**

   Display:
   - Tasks completed this session
   - Overall progress: "N/M tasks complete"
   - If all done: suggest archive
   - If paused: explain why and wait for guidance

**Output During Implementation**

\`\`\`
## Implementing: <change-name> (schema: <schema-name>)

**Options:**
1. <option 1>
2. <option 2>
3. Other approach

What would you like to do?
\`\`\`

**Guardrails**
- Keep going through tasks until done or blocked
- Always read context files before starting (from the apply instructions output)
- If task is ambiguous, pause and ask before implementing
- If implementation reveals issues, pause and suggest artifact updates
- Keep code changes minimal and scoped to each task
- Update task checkbox immediately after completing each task
- Pause on errors, blockers, or unclear requirements - don't guess
- Use contextFiles from CLI output, don't assume specific file names

**Fluid Workflow Integration**

This skill supports the "actions on a change" model:

- **Can be invoked anytime**: Before all artifacts are done (if tasks exist), after partial implementation, interleaved with other actions
- **Allows artifact updates**: If implementation reveals design issues, suggest updating artifacts - not phase-locked, work fluidly`

    instructions: `Fast-forward through artifact creation - generate everything needed to start implementation in one go.

**Input**: The user's request should include a change name (kebab-case) OR a description of what they want to build.

**Steps**

1. **If no clear input provided, ask what they want to build**

   Use the **AskUserQuestion tool** (open-ended, no preset options) to ask:
   > "What change do you want to work on? Describe what you want to build or fix."

   From their description, derive a kebab-case name (e.g., "add user authentication" → \`add-user-auth\`).

   **IMPORTANT**: Do NOT proceed without understanding what the user wants to build.

2. **Create the change directory**
   \`\`\`bash
   projector new change "<name>"
   \`\`\`
   This creates a scaffolded change at \`projector/changes/<name>/\`.

3. **Get the artifact build order**
   \`\`\`bash
   projector status --change "<name>" --json
   \`\`\`
   Parse the JSON to get:
   - \`applyRequires\`: array of artifact IDs needed before implementation (e.g., \`["tasks"]\`)
   - \`artifacts\`: list of all artifacts with their status and dependencies

4. **Create artifacts in sequence until apply-ready**

   Use the **TodoWrite tool** to track progress through the artifacts.

   Loop through artifacts in dependency order (artifacts with no pending dependencies first):

   a. **For each artifact that is \`ready\` (dependencies satisfied)**:
      - Get instructions:
        \`\`\`bash
        projector instructions <artifact-id> --change "<name>" --json
        \`\`\`
      - The instructions JSON includes:
        - \`template\`: The template content to use
        - \`instruction\`: Schema-specific guidance for this artifact type
        - \`outputPath\`: Where to write the artifact
        - \`dependencies\`: Completed artifacts to read for context
      - Read any completed dependency files for context
      - Create the artifact file following the schema's \`instruction\`
      - Show brief progress: "✓ Created <artifact-id>"

   b. **Continue until all \`applyRequires\` artifacts are complete**
      - After creating each artifact, re-run \`projector status --change "<name>" --json\`
      - Check if every artifact ID in \`applyRequires\` has \`status: "done"\` in the artifacts array
      - Stop when all \`applyRequires\` artifacts are done

   c. **If an artifact requires user input** (unclear context):
      - Use **AskUserQuestion tool** to clarify
      - Then continue with creation

5. **Show final status**
   \`\`\`bash
   projector status --change "<name>"
   \`\`\`

**Output**

After completing all artifacts, summarize:
- Change name and location
- List of artifacts created with brief descriptions
- What's ready: "All artifacts created! Ready for implementation."
- Prompt: "Run \`/opsx:apply\` or ask me to implement to start working on the tasks."

**Artifact Creation Guidelines**

- Follow the \`instruction\` field from \`projector instructions\` for each artifact type
- The schema defines what each artifact should contain - follow it
- Read dependency artifacts for context before creating new ones
- Use the \`template\` as a starting point, filling in based on context

**Guardrails**
- Create ALL artifacts needed for implementation (as defined by schema's \`apply.requires\`)
- Always read dependency artifacts before creating a new one
- If context is critically unclear, ask the user - but prefer making reasonable decisions to keep momentum
- If a change with that name already exists, suggest continuing that change instead
- Verify each artifact file exists after writing before proceeding to next`

    instructions: `Sync delta specs from a change to main specs.

This is an **agent-driven** operation - you will read delta specs and directly edit main specs to apply the changes. This allows intelligent merging (e.g., adding a scenario without copying the entire requirement).

**Input**: Optionally specify a change name. If omitted, MUST prompt for available changes.

**Steps**

1. **If no change name provided, prompt for selection**

   Run \`projector list --json\` to get available changes. Use the **AskUserQuestion tool** to let the user select.

   Show changes that have delta specs (under \`specs/\` directory).

   **IMPORTANT**: Do NOT guess or auto-select a change. Always let the user choose.

2. **Find delta specs**

   Look for delta spec files in \`projector/changes/<name>/specs/*/spec.md\`.

   Each delta spec file contains sections like:
   - \`## ADDED Requirements\` - New requirements to add
   - \`## MODIFIED Requirements\` - Changes to existing requirements
   - \`## REMOVED Requirements\` - Requirements to remove
   - \`## RENAMED Requirements\` - Requirements to rename (FROM:/TO: format)

   If no delta specs found, inform user and stop.

3. **For each delta spec, apply changes to main specs**

   For each capability with a delta spec at \`projector/changes/<name>/specs/<capability>/spec.md\`:

   a. **Read the delta spec** to understand the intended changes

   b. **Read the main spec** at \`projector/specs/<capability>/spec.md\` (may not exist yet)

   c. **Apply changes intelligently**:

      **ADDED Requirements:**
      - If requirement doesn't exist in main spec → add it
      - If requirement already exists → update it to match (treat as implicit MODIFIED)

      **MODIFIED Requirements:**
      - Find the requirement in main spec
      - Apply the changes - this can be:
        - Adding new scenarios (don't need to copy existing ones)
        - Modifying existing scenarios
        - Changing the requirement description
      - Preserve scenarios/content not mentioned in the delta

      **REMOVED Requirements:**
      - Remove the entire requirement block from main spec

      **RENAMED Requirements:**
      - Find the FROM requirement, rename to TO

   d. **Create new main spec** if capability doesn't exist yet:
      - Create \`projector/specs/<capability>/spec.md\`
      - Add Purpose section (can be brief, mark as TBD)
      - Add Requirements section with the ADDED requirements

4. **Show summary**

   After applying all changes, summarize:
   - Which capabilities were updated
   - What changes were made (requirements added/modified/removed/renamed)

**Delta Spec Format Reference**

\`\`\`markdown
## ADDED Requirements

### Requirement: New Feature
The system SHALL do something new.

#### Scenario: Basic case
- **WHEN** user does X
- **THEN** system does Y

## MODIFIED Requirements

### Requirement: Existing Feature
#### Scenario: New scenario to add
- **WHEN** user does A
- **THEN** system does B

## REMOVED Requirements

### Requirement: Deprecated Feature

## RENAMED Requirements

- FROM: \`### Requirement: Old Name\`
- TO: \`### Requirement: New Name\`
\`\`\`

**Key Principle: Intelligent Merging**

Unlike programmatic merging, you can apply **partial updates**:
- To add a scenario, just include that scenario under MODIFIED - don't copy existing scenarios
- The delta represents *intent*, not a wholesale replacement
- Use your judgment to merge changes sensibly

**Output On Success**

\`\`\`
## Specs Synced: <change-name>

Updated main specs:

**<capability-1>**:
- Added requirement: "New Feature"
- Modified requirement: "Existing Feature" (added 1 scenario)

**<capability-2>**:
- Created new spec file
- Added requirement: "Another Feature"

Main specs are now updated. The change remains active - archive when implementation is complete.
\`\`\`

**Guardrails**
- Read both delta and main specs before making changes
- Preserve existing content not mentioned in delta
- If something is unclear, ask for clarification
- Show what you're changing as you go
- The operation should be idempotent - running twice should give same result`

**This is a stance, not a workflow.** There are no fixed steps, no required sequence, no mandatory outputs. You're a thinking partner helping the user explore.

**Input**: The argument after \`/opsx:explore\` is whatever the user wants to think about. Could be:
- A vague idea: "real-time collaboration"
- A specific problem: "the auth system is getting unwieldy"
- A change name: "add-dark-mode" (to explore in context of that change)
- A comparison: "postgres vs sqlite for this"
- Nothing (just enter explore mode)

---

## The Stance

- **Curious, not prescriptive** - Ask questions that emerge naturally, don't follow a script
- **Visual** - Use ASCII diagrams liberally when they'd help clarify thinking
- **Adaptive** - Follow interesting threads, pivot when new information emerges
- **Patient** - Don't rush to conclusions, let the shape of the problem emerge
- **Grounded** - Explore the actual codebase when relevant, don't just theorize

---

## What You Might Do

Depending on what the user brings, you might:

**Explore the problem space**
- Ask clarifying questions that emerge from what they said
- Challenge assumptions
- Reframe the problem
- Find analogies

**Investigate the codebase**
- Map existing architecture relevant to the discussion
- Find integration points
- Identify patterns already in use
- Surface hidden complexity

**Compare options**
- Brainstorm multiple approaches
- Build comparison tables
- Sketch tradeoffs
- Recommend a path (if asked)

**Visualize**

## Projector Awareness

You have full context of the Projector system. Use it naturally, don't force it.

### Check for context

At the start, quickly check what exists:
\`\`\`bash
projector list --json
\`\`\`

This tells you:
- If there are active changes
- Their names, schemas, and status
- What the user might be working on

If the user mentioned a specific change name, read its artifacts for context.

### When no change exists

Think freely. When insights crystallize, you might offer:

- "This feels solid enough to start a change. Want me to create one?"
  → Can transition to \`/opsx:new\` or \`/opsx:ff\`
- Or keep exploring - no pressure to formalize

### When a change exists

If the user mentions a change or you detect one is relevant:

1. **Read existing artifacts for context**
   - \`projector/changes/<name>/proposal.md\`
   - \`projector/changes/<name>/design.md\`
   - \`projector/changes/<name>/tasks.md\`
   - etc.

2. **Reference them naturally in conversation**
   - "Your design mentions using Redis, but we just realized SQLite fits better..."
   - "The proposal scopes this to premium users, but we're now thinking everyone..."

3. **Offer to capture when decisions are made**

   | Insight Type | Where to Capture |
   |--------------|------------------|
   | New requirement discovered | \`specs/<capability>/spec.md\` |
   | Requirement changed | \`specs/<capability>/spec.md\` |
   | Design decision made | \`design.md\` |
   | Scope changed | \`proposal.md\` |
   | New work identified | \`tasks.md\` |
   | Assumption invalidated | Relevant artifact |

   Example offers:
   - "That's a design decision. Capture it in design.md?"
   - "This is a new requirement. Add it to specs?"
   - "This changes scope. Update the proposal?"

4. **The user decides** - Offer and move on. Don't pressure. Don't auto-capture.

---

## What You Don't Have To Do

- Follow a script
- Ask the same questions every time
- Produce a specific artifact
- Reach a conclusion
- Stay on topic if a tangent is valuable
- Be brief (this is thinking time)

---

## Ending Discovery

There's no required ending. Discovery might:

- **Flow into action**: "Ready to start? \`/opsx:new\` or \`/opsx:ff\`"
- **Result in artifact updates**: "Updated design.md with these decisions"
- **Just provide clarity**: User has what they need, moves on
- **Continue later**: "We can pick this up anytime"

When things crystallize, you might offer a summary - but it's optional. Sometimes the thinking IS the value.

---

## Guardrails

- **Don't fake understanding** - If something is unclear, dig deeper
- **Don't rush** - Discovery is thinking time, not task time
- **Don't force structure** - Let patterns emerge naturally
- **Don't auto-capture** - Offer to save insights, don't just do it
- **Do visualize** - A good diagram is worth many paragraphs
- **Do explore the codebase** - Ground discussions in reality
- **Do question assumptions** - Including the user's and your own`

    description: 'Start a new change using the experimental artifact workflow (OPSX)',
    category: 'Workflow',
    tags: ['workflow', 'artifacts', 'experimental'],
    content: `Start a new change using the experimental artifact-driven approach.

**Input**: The argument after \`/opsx:new\` is the change name (kebab-case), OR a description of what the user wants to build.

**Steps**

1. **If no input provided, ask what they want to build**

   Use the **AskUserQuestion tool** (open-ended, no preset options) to ask:
   > "What change do you want to work on? Describe what you want to build or fix."

   From their description, derive a kebab-case name (e.g., "add user authentication" → \`add-user-auth\`).

   **IMPORTANT**: Do NOT proceed without understanding what the user wants to build.

2. **Determine the workflow schema**

   Use the default schema (omit \`--schema\`) unless the user explicitly requests a different workflow.

   **Use a different schema only if the user mentions:**
   - "tdd" or "test-driven" → use \`--schema tdd\`
   - A specific schema name → use \`--schema <name>\`
   - "show workflows" or "what workflows" → run \`projector schemas --json\` and let them choose

   **Otherwise**: Omit \`--schema\` to use the default.

3. **Create the change directory**
   \`\`\`bash
   projector new change "<name>"
   \`\`\`
   Add \`--schema <name>\` only if the user requested a specific workflow.
   This creates a scaffolded change at \`projector/changes/<name>/\` with the selected schema.

4. **Show the artifact status**
   \`\`\`bash
   projector status --change "<name>"
   \`\`\`
   This shows which artifacts need to be created and which are ready (dependencies satisfied).

5. **Get instructions for the first artifact**
   The first artifact depends on the schema. Check the status output to find the first artifact with status "ready".
   \`\`\`bash
   projector instructions <first-artifact-id> --change "<name>"
   \`\`\`
   This outputs the template and context for creating the first artifact.

6. **STOP and wait for user direction**

**Output**

After completing the steps, summarize:
- Change name and location
- Schema/workflow being used and its artifact sequence
- Current status (0/N artifacts complete)
- The template for the first artifact
- Prompt: "Ready to create the first artifact? Run \`/opsx:continue\` or just describe what this change is about and I'll draft it."

**Guardrails**
- Do NOT create any artifacts yet - just show the instructions
- Do NOT advance beyond showing the first artifact template
- If the name is invalid (not kebab-case), ask for a valid name
- If a change with that name already exists, suggest using \`/opsx:continue\` instead
- Pass --schema if using a non-default workflow`

    content: `Continue working on a change by creating the next artifact.

**Input**: Optionally specify \`--change <name>\` after \`/opsx:continue\`. If omitted, MUST prompt for available changes.

**Steps**

1. **If no change name provided, prompt for selection**

   Run \`projector list --json\` to get available changes sorted by most recently modified. Then use the **AskUserQuestion tool** to let the user select which change to work on.

   Present the top 3-4 most recently modified changes as options, showing:
   - Change name
   - Schema (from \`schema\` field if present, otherwise "spec-driven")
   - Status (e.g., "0/5 tasks", "complete", "no tasks")
   - How recently it was modified (from \`lastModified\` field)

   Mark the most recently modified change as "(Recommended)" since it's likely what the user wants to continue.

   **IMPORTANT**: Do NOT guess or auto-select a change. Always let the user choose.

2. **Check current status**
   \`\`\`bash
   projector status --change "<name>" --json
   \`\`\`
   Parse the JSON to understand current state. The response includes:
   - \`schemaName\`: The workflow schema being used (e.g., "spec-driven", "tdd")
   - \`artifacts\`: Array of artifacts with their status ("done", "ready", "blocked")
   - \`isComplete\`: Boolean indicating if all artifacts are complete

3. **Act based on status**:

   ---

   **If all artifacts are complete (\`isComplete: true\`)**:
   - Congratulate the user
   - Show final status including the schema used
   - Suggest: "All artifacts created! You can now implement this change or archive it."
   - STOP

   ---

   **If artifacts are ready to create** (status shows artifacts with \`status: "ready"\`):
   - Pick the FIRST artifact with \`status: "ready"\` from the status output
   - Get its instructions:
     \`\`\`bash
     projector instructions <artifact-id> --change "<name>" --json
     \`\`\`
   - Parse the JSON to get template, dependencies, and what it unlocks
   - **Create the artifact file** using the template as a starting point:
     - Read any completed dependency files for context
     - Fill in the template based on context and user's goals
     - Write to the output path specified in instructions
   - Show what was created and what's now unlocked
   - STOP after creating ONE artifact

   ---

   **If no artifacts are ready (all blocked)**:
   - This shouldn't happen with a valid schema
   - Show status and suggest checking for issues

4. **After creating an artifact, show progress**
   \`\`\`bash
   projector status --change "<name>"
   \`\`\`

**Output**

After each invocation, show:
- Which artifact was created
- Schema workflow being used
- Current progress (N/M complete)
- What artifacts are now unlocked
- Prompt: "Run \`/opsx:continue\` to create the next artifact"

**Artifact Creation Guidelines**

The artifact types and their purpose depend on the schema. Use the \`instruction\` field from the instructions output to understand what to create.

Common artifact patterns:

**spec-driven schema** (proposal → specs → design → tasks):
- **proposal.md**: Ask user about the change if not clear. Fill in Why, What Changes, Capabilities, Impact.
  - The Capabilities section is critical - each capability listed will need a spec file.
- **specs/*.md**: Create one spec per capability listed in the proposal.
- **design.md**: Document technical decisions, architecture, and implementation approach.
- **tasks.md**: Break down implementation into checkboxed tasks.

**tdd schema** (spec → tests → implementation → docs):
- **spec.md**: Feature specification defining what to build.
- **tests/*.test.ts**: Write tests BEFORE implementation (TDD red phase).
- **src/*.ts**: Implement to make tests pass (TDD green phase).
- **docs/*.md**: Document the implemented feature.

For other schemas, follow the \`instruction\` field from the CLI output.

**Guardrails**
- Create ONE artifact per invocation
- Always read dependency artifacts before creating a new one
- Never skip artifacts or create out of order
- If context is unclear, ask the user before creating
- Verify the artifact file exists after writing before marking progress
- Use the schema's artifact sequence, don't assume specific artifact names`

/**

    tags: ['workflow', 'artifacts', 'experimental'],
    content: `Implement tasks from an Projector change.

**Input**: Optionally specify \`--change <name>\` after \`/opsx:apply\`. If omitted, MUST prompt for available changes.

**Steps**

1. **If no change name provided, prompt for selection**

   Run \`projector list --json\` to get available changes. Use the **AskUserQuestion tool** to let the user select.

   Show changes that are implementation-ready (have tasks artifact).
   Include the schema used for each change if available.
   Mark changes with incomplete tasks as "(In Progress)".

   **IMPORTANT**: Do NOT guess or auto-select a change. Always let the user choose.

2. **Check status to understand the schema**
   \`\`\`bash
   projector status --change "<name>" --json
   \`\`\`
   Parse the JSON to understand:
   - \`schemaName\`: The workflow being used (e.g., "spec-driven", "tdd")
   - Which artifact contains the tasks (typically "tasks" for spec-driven, check status for others)

3. **Get apply instructions**

   \`\`\`bash
   projector instructions apply --change "<name>" --json
   \`\`\`

   This returns:
   - Context file paths (varies by schema)
   - Progress (total, complete, remaining)
   - Task list with status
   - Dynamic instruction based on current state

   **Handle states:**
   - If \`state: "blocked"\` (missing artifacts): show message, suggest using \`/opsx:continue\`
   - If \`state: "all_done"\`: congratulate, suggest archive
   - Otherwise: proceed to implementation

4. **Read context files**

   Read the files listed in \`contextFiles\` from the apply instructions output.
   The files depend on the schema being used:
   - **spec-driven**: proposal, specs, design, tasks
   - **tdd**: spec, tests, implementation, docs
   - Other schemas: follow the contextFiles from CLI output

5. **Show current progress**

   Display:
   - Schema being used
   - Progress: "N/M tasks complete"
   - Remaining tasks overview
   - Dynamic instruction from CLI

6. **Implement tasks (loop until done or blocked)**

   For each pending task:
   - Show which task is being worked on
   - Make the code changes required
   - Keep changes minimal and focused
   - Mark task complete in the tasks file: \`- [ ]\` → \`- [x]\`
   - Continue to next task

   **Pause if:**
   - Task is unclear → ask for clarification
   - Implementation reveals a design issue → suggest updating artifacts
   - Error or blocker encountered → report and wait for guidance
   - User interrupts

7. **On completion or pause, show status**

   Display:
   - Tasks completed this session
   - Overall progress: "N/M tasks complete"
   - If all done: suggest archive
   - If paused: explain why and wait for guidance

**Output During Implementation**

\`\`\`
## Implementing: <change-name> (schema: <schema-name>)

2. <option 2>
3. Other approach

What would you like to do?
\`\`\`

**Guardrails**
- Keep going through tasks until done or blocked
- Always read context files before starting (from the apply instructions output)
- If task is ambiguous, pause and ask before implementing
- If implementation reveals issues, pause and suggest artifact updates
- Keep code changes minimal and scoped to each task
- Update task checkbox immediately after completing each task
- Pause on errors, blockers, or unclear requirements - don't guess
- Use contextFiles from CLI output, don't assume specific file names

**Fluid Workflow Integration**

This skill supports the "actions on a change" model:

- **Can be invoked anytime**: Before all artifacts are done (if tasks exist), after partial implementation, interleaved with other actions
- **Allows artifact updates**: If implementation reveals design issues, suggest updating artifacts - not phase-locked, work fluidly`

    content: `Fast-forward through artifact creation - generate everything needed to start implementation.

**Input**: The argument after \`/opsx:ff\` is the change name (kebab-case), OR a description of what the user wants to build.

**Steps**

1. **If no input provided, ask what they want to build**

   Use the **AskUserQuestion tool** (open-ended, no preset options) to ask:
   > "What change do you want to work on? Describe what you want to build or fix."

   From their description, derive a kebab-case name (e.g., "add user authentication" → \`add-user-auth\`).

   **IMPORTANT**: Do NOT proceed without understanding what the user wants to build.

2. **Create the change directory**
   \`\`\`bash
   projector new change "<name>"
   \`\`\`
   This creates a scaffolded change at \`projector/changes/<name>/\`.

3. **Get the artifact build order**
   \`\`\`bash
   projector status --change "<name>" --json
   \`\`\`
   Parse the JSON to get:
   - \`applyRequires\`: array of artifact IDs needed before implementation (e.g., \`["tasks"]\`)
   - \`artifacts\`: list of all artifacts with their status and dependencies

4. **Create artifacts in sequence until apply-ready**

   Use the **TodoWrite tool** to track progress through the artifacts.

   Loop through artifacts in dependency order (artifacts with no pending dependencies first):

   a. **For each artifact that is \`ready\` (dependencies satisfied)**:
      - Get instructions:
        \`\`\`bash
        projector instructions <artifact-id> --change "<name>" --json
        \`\`\`
      - The instructions JSON includes:
        - \`template\`: The template content to use
        - \`instruction\`: Schema-specific guidance for this artifact type
        - \`outputPath\`: Where to write the artifact
        - \`dependencies\`: Completed artifacts to read for context
      - Read any completed dependency files for context
      - Create the artifact file following the schema's \`instruction\`
      - Show brief progress: "✓ Created <artifact-id>"

   b. **Continue until all \`applyRequires\` artifacts are complete**
      - After creating each artifact, re-run \`projector status --change "<name>" --json\`
      - Check if every artifact ID in \`applyRequires\` has \`status: "done"\` in the artifacts array
      - Stop when all \`applyRequires\` artifacts are done

   c. **If an artifact requires user input** (unclear context):
      - Use **AskUserQuestion tool** to clarify
      - Then continue with creation

5. **Show final status**
   \`\`\`bash
   projector status --change "<name>"
   \`\`\`

**Output**

After completing all artifacts, summarize:
- Change name and location
- List of artifacts created with brief descriptions
- What's ready: "All artifacts created! Ready for implementation."
- Prompt: "Run \`/opsx:apply\` to start implementing."

**Artifact Creation Guidelines**

- Follow the \`instruction\` field from \`projector instructions\` for each artifact type
- The schema defines what each artifact should contain - follow it
- Read dependency artifacts for context before creating new ones
- Use the \`template\` as a starting point, filling in based on context

**Guardrails**
- Create ALL artifacts needed for implementation (as defined by schema's \`apply.requires\`)
- Always read dependency artifacts before creating a new one
- If context is critically unclear, ask the user - but prefer making reasonable decisions to keep momentum
- If a change with that name already exists, ask if user wants to continue it or create a new one
- Verify each artifact file exists after writing before proceeding to next`

   Count tasks marked with \`- [ ]\` (incomplete) vs \`- [x]\` (complete).

   **If incomplete tasks found:**
   - Display warning showing count of incomplete tasks
   - Use **AskUserQuestion tool** to confirm user wants to proceed
   - Proceed if user confirms

   **If no tasks file exists:** Proceed without task-related warning.

4. **Check if delta specs need syncing**

   Check if \`specs/\` directory exists in the change with spec files.

   **If delta specs exist, perform a quick sync check:**

   a. **For each delta spec** at \`projector/changes/<name>/specs/<capability>/spec.md\`:
      - Extract requirement names (lines matching \`### Requirement: <name>\`)
      - Note which sections exist (ADDED, MODIFIED, REMOVED)

   b. **Check corresponding main spec** at \`projector/specs/<capability>/spec.md\`:
      - If main spec doesn't exist → needs sync
      - If main spec exists, check if ADDED requirement names appear in it
      - If any ADDED requirements are missing from main spec → needs sync

   c. **Report findings:**

      **If sync needed:**
      \`\`\`
      ⚠️ Delta specs may not be synced:
      - specs/auth/spec.md → Main spec missing requirement "Token Refresh"
      - specs/api/spec.md → Main spec doesn't exist yet

      Would you like to sync now before archiving?
      \`\`\`
      - Use **AskUserQuestion tool** with options: "Sync now", "Archive without syncing"
      - If user chooses sync, execute /opsx:sync logic (use the projector-sync-specs skill)

      **If already synced (all requirements found):**
      - Proceed without prompting (specs appear to be in sync)

   **If no delta specs exist:** Proceed without sync-related checks.

5. **Perform the archive**

   Create the archive directory if it doesn't exist:
   \`\`\`bash
   mkdir -p projector/changes/archive
   \`\`\`

   Generate target name using current date: \`YYYY-MM-DD-<change-name>\`

   **Check if target already exists:**
   - If yes: Fail with error, suggest renaming existing archive or using different date
   - If no: Move the change directory to archive

   \`\`\`bash
   mv projector/changes/<name> projector/changes/archive/YYYY-MM-DD-<name>
   \`\`\`

6. **Display summary**

   Show archive completion summary including:
   - Change name
   - Schema that was used
   - Archive location
   - Whether specs were synced (if applicable)
   - Note about any warnings (incomplete artifacts/tasks)

**Output On Success**

\`\`\`
## Archive Complete

**Change:** <change-name>
**Schema:** <schema-name>
**Archived to:** projector/changes/archive/YYYY-MM-DD-<name>/
**Specs:** ✓ Synced to main specs (or "No delta specs" or "⚠️ Not synced")

All artifacts complete. All tasks complete.
\`\`\`

**Guardrails**
- Always prompt for change selection if not provided
- Use artifact graph (projector status --json) for completion checking
- Don't block archive on warnings - just inform and confirm
- Preserve .projector.yaml when moving to archive (it moves with the directory)
- Show clear summary of what happened
- If sync is requested, use projector-sync-specs approach (agent-driven)
- Quick sync check: look for requirement names in delta specs, verify they exist in main specs`

export function getOpsxSyncCommandTemplate(): CommandTemplate {

    name: 'OPSX: Sync',
    description: 'Sync delta specs from a change to main specs',
    category: 'Workflow',
    tags: ['workflow', 'specs', 'experimental'],
    content: `Sync delta specs from a change to main specs.

This is an **agent-driven** operation - you will read delta specs and directly edit main specs to apply the changes. This allows intelligent merging (e.g., adding a scenario without copying the entire requirement).

**Input**: Optionally specify \`--change <name>\` after \`/opsx:sync\`. If omitted, MUST prompt for available changes.

**Steps**

1. **If no change name provided, prompt for selection**

   Run \`projector list --json\` to get available changes. Use the **AskUserQuestion tool** to let the user select.

   Show changes that have delta specs (under \`specs/\` directory).

   **IMPORTANT**: Do NOT guess or auto-select a change. Always let the user choose.

2. **Find delta specs**

   Look for delta spec files in \`projector/changes/<name>/specs/*/spec.md\`.

   Each delta spec file contains sections like:
   - \`## ADDED Requirements\` - New requirements to add
   - \`## MODIFIED Requirements\` - Changes to existing requirements
   - \`## REMOVED Requirements\` - Requirements to remove
   - \`## RENAMED Requirements\` - Requirements to rename (FROM:/TO: format)

   If no delta specs found, inform user and stop.

3. **For each delta spec, apply changes to main specs**

   For each capability with a delta spec at \`projector/changes/<name>/specs/<capability>/spec.md\`:

   a. **Read the delta spec** to understand the intended changes

   b. **Read the main spec** at \`projector/specs/<capability>/spec.md\` (may not exist yet)

   c. **Apply changes intelligently**:

      **ADDED Requirements:**
      - If requirement doesn't exist in main spec → add it
      - If requirement already exists → update it to match (treat as implicit MODIFIED)

      **MODIFIED Requirements:**
      - Find the requirement in main spec
      - Apply the changes - this can be:
        - Adding new scenarios (don't need to copy existing ones)
        - Modifying existing scenarios
        - Changing the requirement description
      - Preserve scenarios/content not mentioned in the delta

      **REMOVED Requirements:**
      - Remove the entire requirement block from main spec

      **RENAMED Requirements:**
      - Find the FROM requirement, rename to TO

   d. **Create new main spec** if capability doesn't exist yet:
      - Create \`projector/specs/<capability>/spec.md\`
      - Add Purpose section (can be brief, mark as TBD)
      - Add Requirements section with the ADDED requirements

4. **Show summary**

   After applying all changes, summarize:
   - Which capabilities were updated
   - What changes were made (requirements added/modified/removed/renamed)

**Delta Spec Format Reference**

\`\`\`markdown
## ADDED Requirements

### Requirement: New Feature
The system SHALL do something new.

#### Scenario: Basic case
- **WHEN** user does X
- **THEN** system does Y

## MODIFIED Requirements

### Requirement: Existing Feature
#### Scenario: New scenario to add
- **WHEN** user does A
- **THEN** system does B

## REMOVED Requirements

### Requirement: Deprecated Feature

## RENAMED Requirements

- FROM: \`### Requirement: Old Name\`
- TO: \`### Requirement: New Name\`
\`\`\`

**Key Principle: Intelligent Merging**

Unlike programmatic merging, you can apply **partial updates**:
- To add a scenario, just include that scenario under MODIFIED - don't copy existing scenarios
- The delta represents *intent*, not a wholesale replacement
- Use your judgment to merge changes sensibly

**Output On Success**

\`\`\`
## Specs Synced: <change-name>

Updated main specs:

**<capability-1>**:
- Added requirement: "New Feature"
- Modified requirement: "Existing Feature" (added 1 scenario)

**<capability-2>**:
- Created new spec file
- Added requirement: "Another Feature"

Main specs are now updated. The change remains active - archive when implementation is complete.
\`\`\`

**Guardrails**
- Read both delta and main specs before making changes
- Preserve existing content not mentioned in delta
- If something is unclear, ask for clarification
- Show what you're changing as you go
- The operation should be idempotent - running twice should give same result`

**Input**: Optionally specify \`--change <name>\` after \`/opsx:archive\`. If omitted, MUST prompt for available changes.

**Steps**

1. **If no change name provided, prompt for selection**

   Run \`projector list --json\` to get available changes. Use the **AskUserQuestion tool** to let the user select.

   Show only active changes (not already archived).
   Include the schema used for each change if available.

   **IMPORTANT**: Do NOT guess or auto-select a change. Always let the user choose.

2. **Check artifact completion status**

   Run \`projector status --change "<name>" --json\` to check artifact completion.

   Parse the JSON to understand:
   - \`schemaName\`: The workflow being used
   - \`artifacts\`: List of artifacts with their status (\`done\` or other)

   **If any artifacts are not \`done\`:**
   - Display warning listing incomplete artifacts
   - Prompt user for confirmation to continue
   - Proceed if user confirms

3. **Check task completion status**

   Read the tasks file (typically \`tasks.md\`) to check for incomplete tasks.

   Count tasks marked with \`- [ ]\` (incomplete) vs \`- [x]\` (complete).

   **If incomplete tasks found:**
   - Display warning showing count of incomplete tasks

4. **Check if delta specs need syncing**

   Check if \`specs/\` directory exists in the change with spec files.

   **If delta specs exist, perform a quick sync check:**

   a. **For each delta spec** at \`projector/changes/<name>/specs/<capability>/spec.md\`:
      - Extract requirement names (lines matching \`### Requirement: <name>\`)

      \`\`\`
      - Use **AskUserQuestion tool** with options: "Sync now", "Archive without syncing"
      - If user chooses sync, execute \`/opsx:sync\` logic

      **If already synced (all requirements found):**
      - Proceed without prompting (specs appear to be in sync)

   **If no delta specs exist:** Proceed without sync-related checks.

5. **Perform the archive**

   Create the archive directory if it doesn't exist:
   \`\`\`bash
   mkdir -p projector/changes/archive
   \`\`\`

   Generate target name using current date: \`YYYY-MM-DD-<change-name>\`

   **Check if target already exists:**
   - If yes: Fail with error, suggest renaming existing archive or using different date
   - If no: Move the change directory to archive

   \`\`\`bash
   mv projector/changes/<name> projector/changes/archive/YYYY-MM-DD-<name>
   \`\`\`

6. **Display summary**

   Show archive completion summary including:
   - Change name
   - Schema that was used
   - Archive location
   - Spec sync status (synced / not synced / no delta specs)
   - Note about any warnings (incomplete artifacts/tasks)
