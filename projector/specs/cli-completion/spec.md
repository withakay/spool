# cli-completion Specification

## Purpose
Provide shell completion scripts for the Projector CLI, enabling tab-completion for commands, flags, and dynamic values (change IDs, spec IDs) across multiple shells. Supports Zsh, Bash, Fish, and PowerShell.
## Requirements
### Requirement: Native Shell Behavior Integration

The completion system SHALL respect and integrate with each supported shell's native completion patterns and user interaction model.

### Requirement: Command Structure

The completion command SHALL follow a subcommand pattern for generating and managing completion scripts.

#### Scenario: Available subcommands

### Requirement: Shell Detection

The completion system SHALL automatically detect the user's current shell environment.

#### Scenario: Detecting Zsh from environment

- **WHEN** no shell is explicitly specified
- **THEN** read the `$SHELL` environment variable
- **AND** extract the shell name from the path (e.g., `/bin/zsh` → `zsh`)
- **AND** validate the shell is one of: `zsh`, `bash`, `fish`, `powershell`
- **AND** throw an error if the shell is not supported

#### Scenario: Detecting Bash from environment

- **WHEN** `$SHELL` contains `bash` in the path
- **THEN** detect shell as `bash`
- **AND** proceed with bash-specific completion logic

#### Scenario: Detecting Fish from environment

- **WHEN** `$SHELL` contains `fish` in the path
- **THEN** detect shell as `fish`
- **AND** proceed with fish-specific completion logic

#### Scenario: Detecting PowerShell from environment

- **WHEN** `$PSModulePath` environment variable is present
- **THEN** detect shell as `powershell`
- **AND** proceed with PowerShell-specific completion logic

#### Scenario: Unsupported shell detection

- **WHEN** shell path indicates an unsupported shell
- **THEN** throw error: "Shell '<name>' is not supported. Supported shells: zsh, bash, fish, powershell"

### Requirement: Architecture Patterns

The completion implementation SHALL follow clean architecture principles with TypeScript best practices, supporting multiple shells through a plugin-based pattern.

#### Scenario: Shell-specific generators

- **WHEN** implementing completion generators
- **THEN** create generator classes for each shell: `ZshGenerator`, `BashGenerator`, `FishGenerator`, `PowerShellGenerator`
- **AND** implement a common `CompletionGenerator` interface with method:
  - `generate(commands: CommandDefinition[]): string` - Returns complete shell script
- **AND** each generator handles shell-specific syntax, escaping, and patterns
- **AND** all generators consume the same `CommandDefinition[]` from the command registry

#### Scenario: Shell-specific installers

- **WHEN** implementing completion installers
- **THEN** create installer classes for each shell: `ZshInstaller`, `BashInstaller`, `FishInstaller`, `PowerShellInstaller`
- **AND** implement a common `CompletionInstaller` interface with methods:
  - `install(script: string): Promise<InstallationResult>` - Installs completion script
  - `uninstall(): Promise<{ success: boolean; message: string }>` - Removes completion
- **AND** each installer handles shell-specific paths, config files, and installation patterns

#### Scenario: Factory pattern for shell selection

- **WHEN** selecting shell-specific implementation
- **THEN** use `CompletionFactory` class with static methods:
  - `createGenerator(shell: SupportedShell): CompletionGenerator`
  - `createInstaller(shell: SupportedShell): CompletionInstaller`
- **AND** factory uses switch statements with TypeScript exhaustiveness checking
- **AND** adding new shell requires updating `SupportedShell` type and factory cases

#### Scenario: Dynamic completion providers

- **WHEN** implementing dynamic completions
- **THEN** create a `CompletionProvider` class that encapsulates project discovery logic
- **AND** implement methods:
  - `getChangeIds(): Promise<string[]>` - Discovers active change IDs
  - `getSpecIds(): Promise<string[]>` - Discovers spec IDs
  - `isProjectorProject(): boolean` - Checks if current directory is Projector-enabled
- **AND** implement caching with 2-second TTL using class properties

#### Scenario: Command registry

- **WHEN** defining completable commands
- **THEN** create a centralized `CommandDefinition` type with properties:
  - `name: string` - Command name
  - `description: string` - Help text
  - `flags: FlagDefinition[]` - Available flags
  - `acceptsPositional: boolean` - Whether command takes positional arguments
  - `positionalType: string` - Type of positional (change-id, spec-id, path, shell)
  - `subcommands?: CommandDefinition[]` - Nested subcommands
- **AND** export a `COMMAND_REGISTRY` constant with all command definitions
- **AND** all generators consume this registry to ensure consistency across shells

#### Scenario: Type-safe shell detection

- **WHEN** implementing shell detection
- **THEN** define a `SupportedShell` type as literal type: `'zsh' | 'bash' | 'fish' | 'powershell'`
- **AND** implement `detectShell()` function in `src/utils/shell-detection.ts`
- **AND** return detected shell or throw error with supported shells list

### Requirement: Error Handling

The completion command SHALL provide clear error messages for common failure scenarios.

#### Scenario: Unsupported shell

- **WHEN** user requests completion for unsupported shell (e.g., ksh, csh, tcsh)
- **THEN** display error message: "Shell '<name>' is not supported yet. Currently supported: zsh, bash, fish, powershell"
- **AND** exit with code 1

#### Scenario: Permission errors during installation

- **WHEN** installation fails due to file permission issues
- **THEN** display clear error message indicating permission problem
- **AND** suggest using appropriate permissions or alternative installation method
- **AND** exit with code 1

#### Scenario: Missing shell configuration directory

- **WHEN** expected shell configuration directory doesn't exist
- **THEN** create the directory automatically (with user notification)
- **AND** proceed with installation

#### Scenario: Shell not detected

- **WHEN** `projector completion install` cannot detect current shell
- **THEN** display error: "Could not auto-detect shell. Please specify shell explicitly."
- **AND** display usage hint: "Usage: projector completion <operation> [shell]"
- **AND** exit with code 1

### Requirement: Output Format

The completion command SHALL provide machine-parseable and human-readable output.

#### Scenario: Script generation output

- **WHEN** generating completion script to stdout
- **THEN** output only the completion script content (no extra messages)
- **AND** allow redirection to files: `projector completion generate zsh > /path/to/_projector`

#### Scenario: Installation success output

- **WHEN** installation completes successfully
- **THEN** display formatted success message with:
  - Checkmark indicator
  - Installation location
  - Next steps (shell reload instructions)
- **AND** use colors when terminal supports it (unless `--no-color` is set)

#### Scenario: Verbose installation output

- **WHEN** user provides `--verbose` flag during installation
- **THEN** display detailed steps:
  - Shell detection result
  - Target file paths
  - Configuration modifications
  - File creation confirmations

### Requirement: Testing Support

The completion implementation SHALL be testable with unit and integration tests for all supported shells.

#### Scenario: Mock shell environment

- **WHEN** writing tests for shell detection
- **THEN** allow overriding `$SHELL` and `$PSModulePath` environment variables
- **AND** use dependency injection for file system operations
- **AND** test detection for all four shells independently

#### Scenario: Generator output verification

- **WHEN** testing completion generators
- **THEN** create test suite for each shell generator (zsh, bash, fish, powershell)
- **AND** verify generated scripts contain expected patterns for that shell
- **AND** test that command registry is properly consumed
- **AND** ensure dynamic completion placeholders are present
- **AND** verify shell-specific syntax and escaping

#### Scenario: Installer simulation

- **WHEN** testing installation logic
- **THEN** create test suite for each shell installer
- **AND** use temporary test directories instead of actual home directories
- **AND** verify file creation without modifying real shell configurations
- **AND** test path resolution logic independently
- **AND** mock file system operations to avoid side effects

#### Scenario: Cross-shell consistency

- **WHEN** testing completion behavior
- **THEN** verify all shells support the same commands and flags
- **AND** verify dynamic completions work consistently across shells
- **AND** ensure error messages are consistent across shells
